# smart_contract
Make a smartcontract, then deploy it on a local server.
used getter/setter and modified the property in the constructor
Make test cases to demonstrate its functionality.
Moralis stopped using it since it couldn't be deployed at nodes with high speed.
To deploy the code on the testnet, I added 0.1 Ethereum to my account. They stopped providing service for the ropsten endpoints they had been using before to Q4.
So I decided to use the Goerli, using it as a testnet endpoint as well as a faucet to top the local address. It also interacted with the local blockchain.
For programming, migrating, testing, and console, I utilized the truffle IDE. A secret key was generated using the node and used as the menomic for the testnet.
From the first deployment of the test code to the testnet to the fundamental initialization of the folders with the pre-loaded files, I adhered to the guidelines for creating a smart contract.
